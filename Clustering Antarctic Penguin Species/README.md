Utilize your unsupervised learning skills to clusters in the penguins dataset!

- Import, investigate and pre-process the `"penguins.csv"` dataset.
- Perform a cluster analysis based on a reasonable number of clusters and collect the average values for the clusters. The output should be a DataFrame named `stat_penguins` with one row per cluster that shows the mean of the original variables (or columns in `"penguins.csv"`) by cluster. `stat_penguins` should not include any non-numeric columns.
